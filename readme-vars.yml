  The admin interface is available at `https://DOCKER-HOST-IP:943/admin` (assuming bridge mode) with a default user/password of admin/password

  During first login, make sure that the "Authentication" in the webui is set to "Local" instead of "PAM". Then set up the user accounts with their passwords (user accounts created under PAM do not survive container update or recreation).

  The "admin" account is a system (PAM) account and after container update or recreation, its password reverts back to the default. It is highly recommended to block this user's access for security reasons:
  1) Create another user and set as an admin,
  2) Log in as the new user,
  3) Delete the "admin" user in the gui,
  4) Modify the `as.conf` file under config/etc and replace the line `boot_pam_users.0=admin` with ~~`#boot_pam_users.0=admin`~~ `boot_pam_users.0=kjhvkhv` (this only has to be done once and will survive container recreation)  
  * IMPORTANT NOTE: Commenting out the first pam user in as.conf creates issues in 2.7.5. To make it work while still blocking pam user access, uncomment that line and change admin to a random nonexistent user as described above.

  To ensure your devices can connect to your VPN properly, goto Configuration -> Network Settings -> and change the "Hostname or IP Address" section to either your domain name or public ip address.
